# To Do

1. Case study selection
   a. Quickly select some candidate junctions in low air quality zones using satellite data

2. Emissions simulation options
   a. Aggregate vs time based? - does aggregate match integrated time based.  does sample rate affect emissions calculations?
   b. Different type of vehicles - which vehicles should be included?
   c. Is there some data regarding vehicle types for HCMC or is observation required?
   d. screening experiment - which factors to consider?
   e. output is aggregate emissions and *through-flow*/*accumulation rate*?



3. Think about integration with MBC
   a. Investigate command line simulation and plotting
   b. output file from MBC show factors and levels - what is the format?
   c. how to create configuration etc files for sumo according to experiment design
   d. run multiple simulations and output results
   e. preprocess results and put in a format that is suitable for mbc



Scripting Example

1. Use quickstart_net simulation with varying number of vehicles e.g. 1, 10, 100, 1000
2. Plot aggregate C02, NOx, PM(N).
